title: Why I run VMWare and not VirtualBox
---

VMWare just works

Running VMWare fusion on Mac OS X and VMWare workstations on Windows just works. VMWare will run through all the steps of a linux install leaving you with a box with vmware tools pre-installed.

VMWare keeps the clock in sync so AWS API calls don't fail. There are fixes with virtualbox, but they always seem to break over time for me.

VMWare works with mongodb unlike [virtualbox which uses too much cpu](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11142066/high-idle-cpu-usage-for-mongodb-on-ubuntu-guest-vm).
